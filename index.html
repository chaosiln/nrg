<h1>Welcome</h1>
<h2>To the pages of Chaoslin Nodrog</h2>
<br>
<br>
<p>In the depths of the ancient earth,
<br>
A power lies, awaiting rebirth,
<br>
The Earth-bender, one with the land,
<br>
Thrives with a connection that's grand.
<br>
<br>
<br>
With hands outstretched, they feel the pulse,
<br>
Of nature's beat, an intimate convulse,
<br>
They shape the rocks, the soil, the stones,
<br>
Harnessing power, where it's sown.
<br>
<br>
<br>
With every step, they leave their mark,
<br>
Creating beauty in light or dark,
<br>
Majestic sculptures rise from the ground,
<br>
As harmony and balance resound.
<br>
<br>
<br>
Through valleys deep and mountains high,
<br>
The Earth-bender's spirit starts to fly,
<br>
Their passion ignites, their heart aglow,
<br>
A force of nature they proudly show.
<br>
<br>
<br>
With every bend, they restore and mend,
<br>
Healing wounds that time may send,
<br>
Connected to Earth's primal core,
<br>
They embrace its strength forevermore.
<br>
<br>
<br>
The Earth-bender's touch leaves trails of awe,
<br>
As they dance with elements without a flaw,
<br>
Their connection is fierce, unbroken, true,
<br>
A guardian of nature, through and through.</p>
